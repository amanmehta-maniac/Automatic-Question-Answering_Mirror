 So we see that the life of these pastoral groups was sustained by a careful consideration of a host of factors. Young men came to be recognised as members of the warrior class when they proved their manliness by raiding the cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly come to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is perfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.  How did the life of pastoralists change under colonial rule?  Like the Maasai, other pastoral groups were also forced to live within the confines of special reserves. It is through raids that the power of different pastoral groups was asserted.  Banjaras were yet another well-known group of graziers. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of pastoral activity for their livelihood.  When Pastures Dry  Drought affects the life of pastoralists everywhere. How did pastoral communities elsewhere cope with these changes in the modern world?  This pattern of cyclical movement between summer and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral communities of the Himalayas, including the Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. In many other parts of the world, new laws and settlement patterns forced pastoral communities to alter their lives.  Dhangars were an important pastoral community of Maharashtra.  Like pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed dramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods.  But the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only on their livestock was different. White settlers and European colonists saw pastoralists as dangerous and savage – people with whom all contact had to be minimised. Through these Acts some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. They combined a range of different activities – cultivation, trade, and herding – to make their living. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’. One group of Raikas – known as the Maru (desert) Raikas – herded camels and another group reared sheep and goat. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought under cultivation. In pre-colonial times Maasai society was divided into two social categories – elders and warriors.  Pastoralism in Africa  Let us move to Africa where over half the world’s pastoral population lives.  Further to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders came down to the dry forests of the bhabar in the winter, and went up to the high meadows – the bugyals – in summer.    Colonial Rule and Pastoral Life  Under colonial rule, the life of pastoralists changed dramatically. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes. In the early twentieth century their population in this region was estimated to be 467,000. The timing of their entry and departure was specified, and the number of days they could spend in the forest was limited. When restrictions were imposed on pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used and the quality of patures declined. Other herds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at this time.  How Did these Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists? They had both pastoral and non-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock was depleted. Such a population was easy to identify and control. How? And it was difficult to get permits without trouble and harassment. In winter, when the high mountains were covered with snow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik range. Pastoralists are not relics of the past. They were to be found in the villages of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.  Third, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They were also to be found in the plateaus, plains and deserts of India. In recent years they have been migrating to Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the harvests are cut. Fodder was always in short supply. They, however, were subject to the authority of the elders. Nothing but dry crops like bajra could be sown here. Each of them was given a pass. Many ecologists believe that in dry regions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the most viable form of life. Most of them now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed agriculture is difficult. The permit specified the periods in which they could be legally within a forest. When pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the changes in the modern world. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton, wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in England. When rains fail and pastures are dry, cattle are likely to starve unless they can be moved to areas where forage is available.  Such changes were not experienced only by pastoral communities in India. Pastoralists were also not allowed to enter the markets in white areas. Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if forage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth in the forest was ample. Those who were settled were seen as peaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were considered to be criminal. The tax per head of cattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made increasingly efficient. The number of cattle heads he had and the amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.  Second, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were also being enacted in the different provinces. In 1885, Maasailand was cut into half with an international boundary between British Kenya and German Tanganyika. They had to go looking for work in the towns. After the kharif harvest was cut at this time, the fields had to be fertilised and made ready for the rabi harvest.  Where have the Grazing Lands Gone? Their agricultural stock declined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. They were stated to be criminal by nature and birth. Pastoralists were not allowed to enter these reserves; they could neither hunt animals nor graze their herds in these areas. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. They were now prevented from entering many forests that had earlier provided valuable forage for their cattle.  To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced a series of measures that had important implications. Over vast stretches no crop could be grown. All of them had to adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use of available pastures in different places. This is the time that the fields need manure that the animals provide. They are not people who have no place in the modern world. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural restoration of vegetation growth. They wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places with fixed rights on particular fields. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and donkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. They were cut off from the best grazing lands and forced to live within a semi-arid tract prone to frequent droughts. Their grazing grounds shrank, their movements were regulated, and the revenue they had to pay increased. Many of them began living in towns, and became involved in trade. During the monsoons, the Raikas of Barmer, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner stayed in their home villages, where pasture was available. They change the paths of their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources. As pasture lands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that remain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to be unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural produce.  These Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. It was covered with thorny scrub. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show the pass and pay the tax.  Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions their numbers have expanded over recent decades. By the end of April they began their northern march for their summer grazing grounds. In many regions, they were prohibited from participating in any form of trade.  Over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and settling down, giving up their nomadic life.  In the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. Some also earn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity with agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement their meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism. They were confined to an arid zone with uncertain rainfall and poor pastures. By end September the Bakarwals were on the move again, this time on their downward journey, back to their winter base. Cutting off all links was, however, never really possible, because white colonists had to depend on black labour to bore mines and, build roads and towns. They had a regular income with which they could buy animals, goods and land. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed. They appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. If they overstayed they were liable to fines. This was a semi-arid region with low rainfall and poor soil. The rainfall in the region was meagre and uncertain. The lucky could get more regular work in road or building construction. So they had to find new places to go. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed on the pastures. This adversely affected both their pastoral and trading activities.  Conclusion  So we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world are affected in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern world.  The new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them suddenly changed the lives of pastoralists. They too spent their winter in the low hills of Siwalik range, grazing their flocks in scrub forests. Many of them were originally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in the nineteenth century in search of good pastures. Land revenue was one of the main sources of its finance. Some reduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not enough pasture to feed large numbers. Here the shepherds were welcomed by Konkani peasants. They had to set up a relationship with farmers on the way, so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the soil. They lent money to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes.  But from the colonial period, the Maasai were bound down to a fixed area, confined within a reserve, and prohibited from moving in search of pastures.  Not All were Equally Affected  In Maasailand, as elsewhere in Africa, not all pastoralists were equally affected by the changes in the colonial period. Once this Act came into force, these communities were expected to live only in notified village settlements. They had to judge how long the herds could stay in one area, and know where they could find water and pasture. Since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were available, large numbers of Maasai cattle died of starvation and disease in these years of drought. The warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for the protection of the tribe. With the onset of summer, the snow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline of the animal stock of the pastoralists. Very often these reserves were in areas that had traditionally been regular grazing grounds for Maasai herds. Pastoral Nomads and their Movements  In the Mountains  Even today the Gujjar Bakarwals of Jammu and Kashmir are great herders of goat and sheep. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and dry season. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s the right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. The Konkani peasants also gave supplies of rice which the shepherds took back to the plateau where grain was scarce. Their wives and children stayed back in the villages to look after the animals. Even in the areas they were allowed entry, their movements were regulated. In times of war and famine, they lost nearly everything. When the high mountains were covered with snow, the herds were grazed in the low hills. In these, some customary grazing rights of pastoralists were granted but their movements were severely restricted. The Serengeti National Park, for instance, was created over 14,760 km. As cultivation expanded, pasturelands were turned into cultivated fields. In just two years of severe drought, 1933 and 1934, over half the cattle in the Maasai Reserve died.  One of the problems the Maasais have faced is the continuous loss of their grazing lands. Those found guilty of disobeying the rules were severely punished. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue collection.  The chiefs appointed by the colonial government often accumulated wealth over time. This was a flourishing agricultural tract with high rainfall and rich soil. Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and warriors was adversely affected.  Pastoralists reacted to these changes in a variety of ways. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others did odd jobs. An enquiry in 1930 showed that the Maasai in Kenya possessed 720,000 cattle, 820,000 sheep and 171,000 donkeys. Most of them were shepherds, some were blanket weavers, and still others were buffalo herders. By this Act many communities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified as Criminal Tribes. They defended the community and organised cattle raids. The colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population. When grazing lands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available area of pastureland declined. of Maasai grazing land.  How Did the Pastoralists Cope with these Changes? No pastoralist was allowed access to these forests. That is why, traditionally, pastoralists are nomadic; they move from place to place.  As pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal stock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. Raiding was important in a society where cattle was wealth. Continuous grazing within a small area inevitably meant a deterioration of the quality of pastures. By October the Dhangars harvested their bajra and started on their move west. When the pasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they moved their herds and flock to new areas. Several households came together for this journey, forming what is known as a kafila. Some of them were made headmen of villages in the newly cleared areas. When the pastures were exhausted in one place they moved to a different area to graze their cattle. Next April, once again, they began their march with their goats and sheep, to the summer meadows. In most areas the lands taken over were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists.  In a different area of the mountains, the Gaddi shepherds of Himachal Pradesh had a similar cycle of seasonal movement. This prevented new trees from growing. So expansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures and a problem for pastoralists.  The Borders are Closed  In the nineteenth century, African pastoralists could move over vast areas in search of pastures. The restrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading activities but they were now subject to various restrictions. Some became settled peasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading. Feeding the cattle became a persistent problem. By September they began their return movement. The Dhangar shepherds stayed in the central plateau of Maharashtra during the monsoon. With increasing restrictions on their mobility, pastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. The colonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and young shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. Many of them migrated to this region in the nineteenth century in search of pastures for their animals. They were not allowed to move out without a permit. They had to move because the Forest Department permits that had been issued to them now ruled their lives. They were not allowed to move out with their stock without special permits.  As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts increased in intensity. This led to continuous intensive grazing of these pastures.  These measures led to a serious shortage of pastures. This in turn created a further shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.  From the late nineteenth century, the British colonial government in east Africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand cultivation. Others discovered new pastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.  In Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, again, the dry central plateau was covered with stone and grass, inhabited by cattle, goat and sheep herders. This continuous movement also allowed the pastures to recover; it prevented their overuse. Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from moneylenders to survive. The boundaries of these reserves became the limits within which they could now move. These individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged to settle these lands. Times of drought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers. After 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could no longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of the Indus, as they had done earlier. Subsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for white settlement and the Maasai were pushed into a small area in south Kenya and north Tanzania. The variety of grasses that sprouted provided rich nutritious forage for the animal herds. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet conditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. By these Rules uncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals. In pre-colonial times, the Maasai pastoralists had dominated their agricultural neighbours both economically and politically. These chiefs managed to survive the devastations of war and drought. By October, when these grazing grounds were dry and exhausted, they moved out in search of other pasture and water, and returned again during the next monsoon.  Large areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves like the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Park in Kenya and Serengeti Park in Tanzania. They lived near the woods, cultivated small patches of land, engaged in a variety of petty trades and took care of their herds. In the monsoon this tract became a vast grazing ground for the Dhangar flocks. The Kurumas and Kurubas reared sheep and goats and sold woven blankets. So tax was imposed on land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on animals. Before colonial times, Maasailand stretched over a vast area from north Kenya to the steppes of northern Tanzania. This nomadism allows them to survive bad times and avoid crises. They needed to calculate the timing of their movements, and ensure that they could move through different territories. In the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts, and left when the rains came.  The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined within. In 1871, the colonial government in India passed the Criminal Tribes Act. When the snow melted and the high passes were clear, many of them moved on to higher mountain meadows. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their movement. Most often, they did not have the resources to tide over bad times. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land Rules were enacted in various parts of the country. Gradually, over the decades, they established themselves in the area, and moved annually between their summer and winter grazing grounds. Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor pastoralists developed. By the 1880s the government began collecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. The village police kept a continuous watch on them. The herds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots. After a march of about a month they reached the Konkan. The sheep could not tolerate the wet monsoon conditions. At times they lost their cattle and sheep and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.  Fourth, to expand its revenue income, the colonial government looked for every possible source of taxation. They crossed the Pir Panjal passes and entered the valley of Kashmir. By April they moved north and spent the summer in Lahul and Spiti. From the late nineteenth century, the colonial government began imposing various restrictions on their mobility. In search of good pastureland for their cattle, they moved over long distances, selling plough cattle and other goods to villagers in exchange for grain and fodder. On the way they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping their summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Usually nomadic pastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another area. They distrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods in villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence every season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds. Similarly, the reservation of forests meant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture their cattle in the forests. The Maasai lost about 60 per cent of their pre-colonial lands. These contractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover the money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as they could within the year. In the late nineteenth century, European imperial powers scrambled for territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different colonies. Then they descended with their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills. So the Raikas combined cultivation with pastoralism.  First, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands into cultivated farms. Earlier, pastoralists not only looked after animal herds but traded in various products.  On the Plateaus, Plains and Deserts  Not all pastoralists operated in the mountains. With the onset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal areas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry plateau. They include communities like Bedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. First, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders and warriors, was disturbed, though it did not break down entirely. They needed a permit for entry. The new political boundaries between India and Pakistan stopped their movement. The dry scrub forests here provided pasture for their herds.  The social changes in Maasai society occurred at two levels. Underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines. Dhangar flocks manured the fields and fed on the stubble. The British imposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare. On cultivated land, harvests fluctuated every year. Modern  Yet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. The Gollas herded cattle.
