Law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to participate in its formation, personally or through their representatives. All citizens are equal before it. No man may be accused, arrested or detained, except in cases determined by the law. Every citizen may speak, write and print freely; he must take responsibility for the abuse of such liberty in cases determined by the law. For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenses of administration a common tax is indispensable; it must be assessed equally on all citizens in proportion to their means. Since pr operty is a sacred and inviolable right, no one may be deprived of it, unless a legally established public necessity requires it.
