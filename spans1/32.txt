The aim of every political association is the preservation of the natural and inalienable rights of man; these are liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression. The source of all sovereignty resides in the nation; no group or individual may exercise authority that does not come from the people. Liberty consists of the power to do whatever is not injurious to others. The law has the right to forbid only actions that are injurious to society. Law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to participate in its formation, personally or through their representatives. All citizens are equal before it.
