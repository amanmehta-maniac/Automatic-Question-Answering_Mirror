Their wages were lower than those of men.   In order to discuss and voice their interests women started their own political clubs and newspapers. About sixty womenâ€™s clubs came up in different French cities. The Society of Revolutionary and Republican Women was the most famous of them. One of their main demands was that women enjoy the same political rights as men. Women were disappointed that the Constitution of 1791 reduced them to passive citizens. They demanded the right to vote, to be elected to the Assembly and to hold political office.
