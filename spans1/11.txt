Georges Danton, who later became active in revolutionary politics, wrote to a friend in 1793, looking back upon the time when he had just completed his studies: â€˜I was educated in the residential college of Plessis. There I was in the company of important men. . . Once my studies ended, I was left with nothing. I started looking for a post. It was impossible to find one at the law courts in Paris.
