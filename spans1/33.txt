Liberty consists of the power to do whatever is not injurious to others. The law has the right to forbid only actions that are injurious to society. Law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to participate in its formation, personally or through their representatives. All citizens are equal before it. No man may be accused, arrested or detained, except in cases determined by the law. Every citizen may speak, write and print freely; he must take responsibility for the abuse of such liberty in cases determined by the law.
