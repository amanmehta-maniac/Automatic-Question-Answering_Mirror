Explain the authorities of the elders and the warriors of the Maasai society
Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and warriors was adversely affected. They, however, were subject to the authority of the elders. First, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders and warriors, was disturbed, though it did not break down entirely. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.  The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined within. With the onset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal areas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry plateau. In winter, when the high mountains were covered with snow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik range. The number of cattle heads he had and the amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass. The warriors consisted of younger people, mainly responsible for the protection of the tribe. On the way they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping their summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.  To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced a series of measures that had important implications.  In the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. They appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. They crossed the Pir Panjal passes and entered the valley of Kashmir. Only buffaloes liked the swampy, wet conditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months. With the onset of summer, the snow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. After 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could no longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of the Indus, as they had done earlier. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s the right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if forage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth in the forest was ample. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and dry season. This in turn created a further shortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.  This pattern of cyclical movement between summer and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral communities of the Himalayas, including the Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. They change the paths of their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources.  As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts increased in intensity.
