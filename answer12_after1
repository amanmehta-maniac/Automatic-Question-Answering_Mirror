Explain the authorities of the elders and warriors of the Maasai society?
Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and warriors was adversely affected. They, however, were subject to the authority of the elders. First, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders and warriors, was disturbed, though it did not break down entirely.  The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined within. With the onset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal areas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry plateau. The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes. The number of cattle heads he had and the amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.  As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts increased in intensity.  This pattern of cyclical movement between summer and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral communities of the Himalayas, including the Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and dry season. With the onset of summer, the snow melted and the mountainsides were lush green. The frequent bad years led to a steady decline of the animal stock of the pastoralists.  How Did these Changes Affect the Lives of Pastoralists? When pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the changes in the modern world.  In the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas. They appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were made responsible for the affairs of the tribe.
