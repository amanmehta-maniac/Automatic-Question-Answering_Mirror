Explain the authorities of the Elders and Warriors of the Massai society
['They appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were made responsible for the affairs of the tribe.', 'By the end of colonial rule the situation had reversed.', 'They crossed the Pir Panjal passes and entered the valley of Kashmir.', 'In winter, when the high mountains were covered with snow, they lived with their herds in the low hills of the Siwalik range.', ' To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced a series of measures that had important implications.', 'They change the paths of their annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights to enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for relief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources.', ' In the deserts of Rajasthan lived the Raikas.', 'With the onset of summer, the snow melted and the mountainsides were lush green.', 'Unlike the mountain pastoralists, it was not the cold and the snow that defined the seasonal rhythms of their movement: rather it was the alternation of the monsoon and dry season.', 'The frequent bad years led to a steady decline of the animal stock of the pastoralists.', 'When pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the changes in the modern world.', 'The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.', 'With the onset of the monsoon the Dhangars left the Konkan and the coastal areas with their flocks and returned to their settlements on the dry plateau.', ' As the area of grazing lands shrank, the adverse effect of the droughts increased in intensity.', ' The loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created pressure on the small area of land that the Maasai were confined within.', 'They, however, were subject to the authority of the elders.']
